run all .py "Vxx.py" files by modifying FOLD = 0 or FOLD = 3 in CFG class

all the versions that you might see in the test.ipynb and do not have vxx.py files to run, they are duplicated, so if 2 versions side by side in the notebook have 2 names and only 1 file is included then that file has to be run on FOLD = 0 and FOLD = 3

test with test.ipynb

EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: use folds from files like fold0_train.npy for training idxs and fold0_valid for validation idxs
